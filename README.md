## Abstract

ðŸ”– I'm embedded developer, focused in firmware development, programming in C language and IDEs like Eclipse based (Code Composer, STM32CubeIDE).

ðŸ“Ÿ I have experience with STMicroeletronics microcontrollers (STM8 and STM32), Texas Instruments (CC26x2, MSP430), nRF52810, Microchip 8-bit microcontrollers, and some others.

# Opinion

ðŸ’¬ It's hard to code for miccrocontrollers, but the result is satisfatory.
